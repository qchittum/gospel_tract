                <h2>What is the Gospel?</h2>
                <p>The word "gospel" means "good news." The gospel of the grace of God is the good news that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died for our sins, was buried, and rose again on the third day according to the Scriptures.</p>

For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures."</p>
